## Code Review for `../my-agent` changes

This pull request introduces significant changes, transforming a basic AI text generation script into a robust, tool-augmented AI agent for code reviews. The overall direction is excellent, focusing on modularity and leveraging AI capabilities effectively.

### `index.ts`

**Changes:**
*   Refactored from a simple `generateText` call to an asynchronous `codeReviewAgent` function using `streamText`.
*   Integrated `getFileChangesInDirectoryTool`, `generateCommitMessageTool`, and `generateMarkdownFileTool`.
*   Introduced `SYSTEM_PROMPT` for the agent's role definition.

**Review:**

1.  **Correctness & Functionality (Good):** The core functionality of setting up an AI agent with tools is correctly implemented. The agent is now capable of interacting with the codebase to provide reviews, generate commit messages, and create markdown files. This is a substantial improvement over the previous simple text generation.
2.  **Modularity (Good):** The introduction of `SYSTEM_PROMPT` imported from a separate file (`./prompts`) is a great step towards better organization and maintainability.
3.  **Tool Integration (Good):** The tools are properly defined and passed to the `streamText` function, making them accessible to the AI model.

4.  **`stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)` (Suggestion):**
    *   **Issue:** The `stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)` condition might prematurely cut off the agent's response. For comprehensive code reviews, especially in larger or more complex scenarios, 10 steps might not be sufficient for the agent to complete its thoughts, provide detailed feedback, or execute multiple tool calls.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   Consider removing this hardcoded limit to allow the agent to complete its natural thought process.
        *   If a limit is necessary for cost or performance, explore making it configurable, perhaps through an environment variable or a function parameter, so it can be adjusted based on the expected complexity of the review.
        *   Alternatively, investigate other `stopWhen` conditions that might be more aligned with task completion rather than a fixed step count, if available.

5.  **Error Handling (Minor Suggestion):**
    *   **Issue:** There isn't explicit error handling around the `streamText` call or potential failures from tool executions.
    *   **Suggestion:** While `streamText` might handle some internal errors, for a production-ready agent, it would be beneficial to wrap the agent's core logic in a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle unexpected errors, log them, and potentially inform the user.

### `prompt.ts` (Deleted)

**Changes:**
*   The `prompt.ts` file has been deleted.

**Review:**
*   This deletion, coupled with the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` import in `index.ts`, suggests that the system prompt content has been successfully refactored and moved to a more appropriate location (presumably `prompts.ts`). This is a positive change for code organization and reduces file clutter.

---

**Overall Impression:**
This is a well-executed set of changes that significantly enhances the `my-agent` project. The move to a tool-augmented agent architecture is a powerful upgrade. Addressing the `stopWhen` condition would make the agent even more robust and reliable for diverse code review scenarios.
